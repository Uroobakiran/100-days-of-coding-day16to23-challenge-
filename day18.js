//**Question 52:** Make a Smartphone Object: 
//Create a simple way to keep track of a smartphone's details. Include its brand,
//  model, and other key features like how much storage it has, the size of 
//  its screen, and how long its battery lasts.
let smartPhone = {
    make: "readme ",

        storage: "256GB",
        screenSize: "6.43",
        batteryLife: "24 hours"
    }
};

// **Question 53:** Pulling Apart a Nested Object: 
// Imagine you have a list inside another list that shows what a computer programmer
//  knows, like coding languages, tools, and software frameworks. Find a way to get 
//  three specific skills from this list and show them.
let devoloperSkills = {
    languages: ["javascript", "c++", "python"],
    tools: ["Jenkins", "Postman", "Kubernetes"],
    frameworks: ["Node.js", "Django", "Flutter"]
};
let { languages, tools, frameworks } = devoloperSkills;
console.log(`Language: ${languages[0]}, Framework: ${frameworks[0]}, Tool: ${tools[0]}`);
export {};
// **Question 54:** Making Flexible Object Keys:
//  Learn how to set up a list where you can change the name of each section
